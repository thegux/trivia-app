# Trivia App

This project is a Trivia Game. Users are able to create questions within specific categories and play with their friends. They can also search for specific questions and check them all at once in a list. It was developed as an assessment of the Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree Program.

## Getting Started

Since this project was intended to run locally, in order to run the App properly you most clone the App to your local machine and follow the 'Getting Started' within the .backend/README.md and .frontend/README.md files.
